    <h1>| History</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;" >
    Chandannagar was established as a French colony in 1673, when the French obtained permission from Ibrahim Khan, the Nawab of Bengal, to establish a trading post on the right bank of the Hughli River. In that year (1673-74) Duplessis, the French Commander,built a house after gathering a plot at Taldanga on the northern part of the present Chandannagar with the permission of Ibrahim Khan, the then Nawab of Bengal.Bengal was then a province of the Mughal Empire. It became a permanent French settlement in 1688, and in 1730 Joseph François Dupleix was appointed governor of the city, during whose administration more than two thousand brick houses were erected in the town and a considerable maritime trade was carried on. For a time, Chandannagar was the main center for European commerce in Bengal. Unlike the rest of India which had been a British colony for two hundred years, Chandannagar was ruled by French.</p>

   <td style="font-size: 25px;" > Then in 1687 the French commander Deslandes started business at Bandel in Hooghly; but coming across many inconveniences he tried to shift to another Gateplace in Hooghly and failed to receive the permission of the Nawab to build a new firm at the very place obtained by Duplessis at Chandannagar. At last in the next year, the French received the permission to carry on duty free business in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa on payment of Rs. 40,000/- to the Moghul Government (Aurungzeb was Emperor then). Deslandes laid the foundation of Chandannagar.
In course of time Chandannagar occupied the topmost position among all foreign settlements of Bengal in trade and commerce. It maintained traderelations with Basora, China, Pegu, Jedda, Tibet etc. In those days Chandannagar was a bigger centre of commerce than Calcutta.</td>

The town’s fortifications and many houses were demolished thereafter, and Chandannagar’s importance as a commercial center was eclipsed by that of Calcutta just downriver. Chandernagore was restored to the French in 1763, but retaken by the British in 1794 in the Napoleonic Wars. Chandannagar continued as the commercial center but completely banking on the local businessmen. Among them Indranarayan Chowdhury was the most prominent figure. In the year 1730 he was appointed the courtier of the Company. He received a gold medal from Louis xv, the King of France. He constructed the temple of Sri Nandadulal and a rest house in the year 1740.</td>
