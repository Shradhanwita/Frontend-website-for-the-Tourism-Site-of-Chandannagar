Neline also asserts having very close relations with the other zamindaris of the time doing a lot of things in collaboration with them. For instance, the Mankundu railway station was built by the collaboration between the Khans and the Mondals and were maintained at their own expenses until independence made it a property of the Government. One of the oldest existing structures from the time of the French occupation of Chandernagore, this house was built by Keshto Mondol, a merchant who worked closely with the French. The family traded primarily in swords and foodgrains and owned quite a few ships. Says Ujjwal Mondol, one of the current residents, “My ancestors also had a private army to counter pirates in the Hooghly. They would escort ships of the Portuguese and other colonial traders and earned good money in the process.” The house designed by French architects is full of artefacts and paintings from the time of Napoleon Bonaparte.
